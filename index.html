        <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong>  who can benefit from
      learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, probably more. To join our

          Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
          Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
          <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
          introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
          <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
          plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
          on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
          interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
          interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
          at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
          tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
